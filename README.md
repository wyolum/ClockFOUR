ClockFOUR
=========

ClockFOUR is a word clock that tells time with words.  It has a 14x13 matrix of letters that, when illuminated, tells time to the minute.  e.g. “SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST FOUR”  The clock is 28 x 28 x ~4 cm.  The main PCB is approximately 24 x 22 cm and has 182 RGB WS2812B pixels on the front.  The back of the PCB contains an Arduino compatible 328P microprocessor and a DS3231 real time clock chip with 2032 battery backup.  Power is provided by a quality international multi-voltage 5V 2-3A power supply with barrel connector.

The user interface consists of two touch sensitive buttons wired to top two metal screw posts. Modes and settings are actuated by short taps and long presses.
